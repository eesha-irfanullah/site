Hi, I'm Eesha, a senior Biomedical Engineering and Technical Communication student at the University of Minnesota. I created this website to fulfill the final project requirements of WRIT 4662W: Writing With Digital Technologies. This website features a few of the projects I've worked on over the course of the semester, as well as an end-of-semester digital literacy narrative reflecting on my progress in the course. For now, I've chosen to feature the static site that I coded from scratch in html and my contributions to the Austin Healey Client Project. In the future, I hope to adapt the concepts I learned while creating both this and my initial static site to create an online professional portfolio featuring my best works over the course of my undergraduate career.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-my-static-site","text":"Hi, I'm Eesha, a senior Biomedical Engineering and Technical Communication student at the University of Minnesota.

This was my first experience using HTML and CSS. My site, which features some of my favorite pictures of my grandmother's garden in Karachi, is quite simplisitc, but the process of creating a website from scratch taught me a lot about web design, as well as how to effectively navigate technical documentation. These skills have come in handy as I continue to edit my HTML 5 UP! template based website, which I hope to eventually adapt into a professional portfolio. My static site is hosted on GitHub. You can view the site here Below is a picture of the homepage of my intended portfolio website which is still a work in progress. I hope to continue working on this website as a summer project Client Project : Minnnesota Austin Healey Club Website I worked collaboratively with my WRIT 4462W class to develop an improved website for the Minnesota Austin Healey Club (MAHC). Improvements were made based on careful consideration of client requests/feedback and site development took place over the course of one month. The final deliverable is a working website prototype in Wordpress.org which can be easily updated as needed. I contributed to this project by performing background research to help identify the best platform for collaborative web-editing, creating wire frames for certain webpages in Figma , auditing the final website content, and contributing to the website's About page . The full website can be accessed here . The original Figma wireframes created prior to website development can be accessed here . Note that wordpress template limitations prevented us from fully replicating the initial wireframes in the final website.","title":"Portfolio"},{"location":"about/#static-site-version-1","text":"The very first project for WRIT 4662W required us to design and build a rudimentary static site from scratch using HTML and CSS.

I also began this course with a very rudimentary understanding of what it meant to write for web environments. My experience with digital literacy was limited to the basic skills of computer and smartphone operation, and internet use that would allow me to complete my school work and remain connected with my friends online. I had heard of things like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DITA, and GitHub, but knew nothing about them beyond the fact that they were somehow useful for technical communication and web development. Since the beginning of the semester, I\u2019ve come a long way, not just in terms of developing digital communication skills, but also in terms of my ability to navigate technical documentation and to both experiment with and troubleshoot the problems I encounter in digital communication. The major way in which my relationship to writing with digital technologies has changed is through my increased confidence in my ability to access and use such technologies as needed. Through the various assignments in this course, I have obtained what I understand to be the essential tools and vocabulary for writing in internet environments. While I previously thought of internet technologies and web development as some sort of abstract concept\u2014a black box of sorts\u2014I now view it as a complex, yet accessible process that can be adapted by anyone with access to the appropriate resources. In short, I now find digital technology far less daunting. I really appreciate the way in which this course was structured. Working with digital technologies and learning about both the relevant theory and techniques enabled us to apply concepts in real time. I would most likely use a similar approach on future projects while exploring new technologies. Figuring out how to access, use and apply technical documentation is perhaps the most valuable lesson I have learnt in this course. I hope to continue to access many of the resources from this course on future projects. I found Linkedin Learning to be particularly useful, and I hope to watch more such courses on my own time to further my digital literacy. Though most of the resources I used for class projects were provided by the instructor, I also gained valuable experience in conducting independent research on various topics. For the client project assignment, for example, doing my own background research into which content management and wireframe development systems were best suited","title":"Digital Literacy Narratives"},{"location":"narrative/#digital-literacy-narrative-v1-january-2021","text":"My first digital literacy narrative, which I wrote at the very beginning of this course can be accessed here","title":"Digital Literacy Narrative v1 (January 2021)"},{"location":"narrative/#digital-literacy-narrative-v2-may-2021-incomplete","text":"My experiences prior to this course had already afforded me a profound appreciation for the importance of digital literacy in modern-day communication.
