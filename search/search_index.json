This was my first experience using HTML and CSS. My site, which features some of my favorite pictures of my grandmother's garden in Karachi, is quite simplisitc, but the process of creating a website from scratch taught me a lot about web design, as well as how to effectively navigate technical documentation. These skills have come in handy as I continue to edit my HTML 5 UP! template based website, which I hope to eventually adapt into a professional portfolio. My static site is hosted on GitHub. You can view the site here Below is a picture of the homepage of my intended portfolio website which is still a work in progress. I hope to continue working on this website as a summer project Client Project : Minnnesota Austin Healey Club Website I worked collaboratively with my WRIT 4462W class to develop an improved website for the Minnesota Austin Healey Club (MAHC). Improvements were made based on careful consideration of client requests/feedback and site development took place over the course of one month. The final deliverable is a working website prototype in Wordpress.org which can be easily updated as needed. I contributed to this project by performing background research to help identify the best platform for collaborative web-editing, creating wire frames for certain webpages in Figma , auditing the final website content, and contributing to the website's About page . The full website can be accessed here . The original Figma wireframes created prior to website development can be accessed here . Note that wordpress template limitations prevented us from fully replicating the initial wireframes in the final website.","title":"Portfolio"},{"location":"about/#static-site-version-1","text":"The very first project for WRIT 4662W required us to design and build a rudimentary static site from scratch using HTML and CSS.

Digital Literacy Narrative v2: Course Reflection (May 2021) My experiences prior to this course had already afforded me a profound appreciation for the importance of digital literacy in modern-day communication. I began this course with a very rudimentary understanding of what it meant to write for web environments. My experience with digital literacy was limited to the basic skills of computer and smartphone operation and internet use necessary to complete my school work and remain connected with my friends online. I had heard of things like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DITA, and GitHub, but knew nothing about them beyond the fact that they were somehow useful for technical communication and web development. Since the beginning of the semester, I\u2019ve come a long way, not just in terms of developing digital communication skills, but also in terms of my ability to navigate technical documentation and to experiment with and troubleshoot exercises in digital communication. The major way in which my relationship to writing with digital technologies has changed is through my increased confidence in my ability to access and use such technologies as needed. Through the various assignments in this course, I have obtained what I understand to be the essential tools and vocabulary for writing in internet environments. While I previously thought of web development as some sort of abstract concept\u2014a black box of sorts\u2014I now view it as a complex, yet accessible process that can be adapted by anyone with access to the appropriate resources. In short, I find digital technology far less daunting. I really appreciate the way this course was structured. Working with digital technologies and learning about both the relevant theory and techniques enabled us to apply concepts in real time. I would most likely use a similar approach on future projects while exploring new technologies. Figuring out how to access, use and apply technical documentation is perhaps the most valuable lesson I have learnt in this course. I hope to continue to access many of the resources from this course on future projects. I also realized that projects are much more satisfying when you figure stuff out yourself rather than being spoon-fed the necessary information. I found Linkedin Learning to be particularly useful, and I hope to watch more such courses on my own time. Though most of the resources I used for class projects were provided by the instructor, I also gained valuable experience in conducting independent research on various topics. For the client project assignment, for example, doing my own background research into which content management and wireframe development systems were best suited for a collaborative web development project. Though in retrospect Wordpress.org may not have been the best choice, the process of conducting independent online research and experimenting with new platforms was enlightening, and I now have a better sense of how to sift through online forums and resources to identify relevant information about writing for web environments. This course has also given me an appreciation for the multiple ways in which digital communication technologies are constantly updating and evolving. The fact that I now feel capable of finding and processing new information makes me much better equipped to thrive in the dynamic world of technical communication. As an engineering major, I\u2019m really glad to have gained experience with GitHub, because I can leverage this technology to streamline work on future group projects which involve non web-development related coding. My only complaint is that I wish I had had more time during the semester to develop the projects I was working on. A lot of the technical documentation used in this course highlighted interesting capabilities of writing technologies that I would have loved to explore. Given the time I would have trouble-shooted my DITA assignment to figure out why it wasn\u2019t producing a streamlined web-responsive output, I would have spent much more time developing my static sites\u2014particularly by curating the content and becoming more familiar with CSS\u2014, and I would have attempted to buy an individualized domain and create a personal portfolio website using GitHub. I\u2019m very glad, however, that I have access to everything I need should I want to continue with these projects in the future! Though I am headed to medical school in the fall, and do not plan on becoming a professional technical communicator, I believe that in today\u2019s information age, digital literacy holds immense value for people of all professions\u2014particularly those in STEM. On an individual and more immediate level, I plan to use some of my time over the summer to independently develop and publish a working portfolio website which I hope to maintain over the course of my career. The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced my belief that science and effective communication must intersect to be effective. I believe that the skills I have gained in this course can enhance my impact as a physician by better enabling me to work with technical communicators and/or to communicate directly with 21st century audiences.","title":"Digital Literacy Narratives"},{"location":"narrative/#digital-literacy-narrative-v1-january-2021","text":"My first digital literacy narrative, which I wrote at the very beginning of this course can be accessed here .","title":"Digital Literacy Narrative v1 (January 2021)"},{"location":"narrative/#digital-literacy-narrative-v2-course-reflection-may-2021","text":"My experiences prior to this course had already afforded me a profound appreciation for the importance of digital literacy in modern-day communication.
